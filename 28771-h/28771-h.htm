5</span>CHILD MAIDELVOLD.</h2>
<p>The fair Sidselil, of all maidens the flower,<br />
With her mother the Queen sat at work in her bower.</p>
<p>So hard at the woof the fair Sidselil plies,<br />
That out from her bosom, so white, the milk flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, O Sidselil, child of my heart,<br />
What causes the milk from thy bosom to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that is not milk, my dear mother, I vow,<br />
It is but the mead I was drinking just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike are the two, most unlike to the sight,<br />
The one it is brown, and the other is white.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;I see it is best that the truth be declared,<br />
The handsome Child Maidelvold me has ensnared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it be truth what thou now hast declared,<br />
And handsome Child Maidelvold thee has ensnared,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aloft on the gallows I&rsquo;ll hang him, I trow,<br />
And burn thee to ashes the gallows below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud Sidselil she her blue mantle puts on,<br />
And unto Child Maidelvold&rsquo;s bower she is gone.</p>
<p>With her fingers so tapering she twirled at the pin:<br />
&ldquo;Child Maidelvold rise, and with speed let me
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve summoned no one the tribunal before,<br />
And at night to no one will I open my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child Maidelvold rise, I beseech, in Christ&rsquo;s
name,<br />
I&rsquo;ve spoke to my mother who knows of my shame.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Aloft on the gallows she&rsquo;ll hang thee, I
trow,<br />
And burn me to ashes the gallows below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will not hang, my sweet maiden, for thee<br />
And thou shalt not burn, my sweet maiden, for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collect thou thy gold in the coffer with speed,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll to the stable and saddle my steed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung round the maiden his mantle so wide,<br />
And he lifted her up on his courser of pride.</p>
<p>They came to the wood of the briar and rose,<br />
There Sidselil craved for a while to repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now art thou fatigued by thy journey, sweet love,<br />
Or say, does the saddle too close for thee prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not o&rsquo;ercome by the journey, sweet love,<br
/>
But the saddle too close for my burden doth prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>He spread on the cold earth his mantle so wide:<br />
&ldquo;Here rest thee a space and I&rsquo;ll watch by thy
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Jesus, that one of my maidens were near,<br />
The pains of a mother are on me I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy maidens are now at a distance from thee,<br />
And thou hast no one to assist thee but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere better to perish again and again,<br />
Than thou should&rsquo;st stand by me and gaze on my
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take off thy kerchief and cover my head,<br />
And perhaps I may stand in the wise woman&rsquo;s
stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One draught of pure water could&rsquo;st thou bring me
now,<br />
To cheer up my heart that is sinking so low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So faithful to her was the Child, and so true,<br />
He fetched her the drink in her gold spangled shoe.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Child Maidelvold sped through the forest so black,<br />
He went to the fountain the wearisome track.</p>
<p>And when he arrived at the fount in the vale,<br />
Two nightingales sat there and sang him their tale:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead Sidselil lieth beneath the green bough,<br />
With two little babes on her bosom of snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid little heed to the nightingales&rsquo; lay,<br />
And traced through the forest his wearisome way.</p>
<p>But, ah! what a spectacle burst on his view,<br />
The little birds&rsquo; story he found to be true.</p>
<p>A grave broad and deep has Child Maidelvold made,<br />
Therein the unfortunate three he has laid.</p>
<p>As o&rsquo;er them he clamped the mould down with his boot,<br
/>
He thought that the babies screamed under his foot.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Against a grey stone has the Child set his sword,<br />
The point of the blade his heart mortally gor&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>He was true to his Sidselil whilst he had breath,<br />
He lies &rsquo;neath the earth now beside her in death.</p>
<p>*** Another, but widely different, version of this Ballad was
printed in <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, 1826, pp. 28&ndash;31, under
the title <i>Sir Middel</i>.&nbsp; In this version the name of
the heroine is Swanelil, in place of Sidselil; and that of the
hero is Sir Middel, in place of Child Maidelvold.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>SIR PETER.</h2>
<p>Sir Peter and Kirstin they sat by the board,<br />
Betwixt them in jest there passed many a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, good Sir Peter the knight,<br />
Say, when wilt thou me to thy bridal invite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be held in a far distant country, I
trow,<br />
So far that to come quite unable art thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though thou shouldst hold it, Sir Peter, in
Rome,<br />
If thou shouldst invite me I&rsquo;d certainly come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if at my bridals thou wish to appear,<br />
Behind thou must leave all thy red golden gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my red golden gear I will ever go dight,<br />
For it was not gained by dishonor, Sir Knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Sir Peter he bids them his bridals get ready,<br />
Cries Kirstin: &ldquo;Now shoe ye my palfrey so
steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fair Kirstin she saddles her courser so gray,<br />
To the house of Sir Peter she taketh her way.</p>
<p>She rides her horse into Sir Peter&rsquo;s court yard,<br />
And there stood the knight, clad in sable and mard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Sir Peter, so handsome and fine,<br />
Say, may I this day skink before thee the wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To skink wine before me if thee I permit,<br />
Thou on the stone bench with the servants shalt sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adown her cheeks trickled the tear-drops so free&mdash;<br />
How hard by each mortal insulted to be!</p>
<p>To the high and wide hall good Sir Peter proceeds,<br />
Fair Kirstin behind him in rich scarlet weeds.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>A coronet glittered her temples upon,<br />
And full of gold rings were her fingers, each one.</p>
<p>When into the hall little Kirstin she came,<br />
Uprose to receive her each maiden and dame.</p>
<p>She took in her fair hand the white silver can,<br />
To skink mead before the young knight she began.</p>
<p>The youthful bride said to her servant: &ldquo;Canst tell<br
/>
The name of that skinker, that sweet demoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered the servant, as low as she might:<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only Sir Peter his love-lady light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he possessed such a leman, why rode<br />
Sir Peter the knight to my father&rsquo;s abode?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had good Sir Peter a leman so brave,<br />
O why did he me of my father e&rsquo;er crave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More gold she displays on her ten fingers small,<br />
Than my father could show in his good castle all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Now o&rsquo;er was the supper, the laugh and the
song,<br />
To retire to her bed the young bride she doth long.</p>
<p>With the bride to the bridal apartment they go,<br />
Fair Kirstin in front bears the yellow flambeau.</p>
<p>The bride in the soft bridal couch they have plac&rsquo;d,<br
/>
To come to her arms good Sir Peter made haste.</p>
<h2><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.</h2>
<p>Ingefred and Gudrune they sate in their bower,<br />
Each bloomed a beauteous fragrant flower&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So sweet it is in summer tide</i>!</p>
<p>A working the gold fair Ingefred kept,<br />
Still sate Gudrune, and bitterly wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sister Gudrune so fain I&rsquo;d know<br />
Why down thy cheek the salt tears flow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause enough have I to be thus forlorn,<br />
With a load of sorrow my heart is worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, Ingefred, hear what I say to thee,<br />
Wilt thou to-night stand bride for me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If bride for me thou wilt stand to-night,<br />
I&rsquo;ll give thee my bridal clothes thee to requite.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;And more, much more to thee I&rsquo;ll give,<br
/>
All my bride jewels thou shalt receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will not stand for bride in thy room,<br />
Save I also obtain thy merry bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betide me whatever the Lord ordain<br />
From me my bridegroom thou never shalt gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silks so costly the bride they arrayed,<br />
And unto the kirk the bride they conveyed.</p>
<p>In golden cloth weed the holy priest stands,<br />
He joins of Gudrune and Samsing the hands.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er the downs and green grass meadows they sped,<br />
Where the herdsman watched his herd as it fed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of thy beauteous self, dear Damsel, take heed,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er enter the house of Sir Samsing, I rede.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Samsing possesses two nightingales<br />
Who tell of the Ladies such wondrous tales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With their voices of harmony they can declare<br />
Whether maiden or none has fallen to his share.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>The chariot they stopped in the green wood shade,<br />
An exchange &rsquo;twixt them of their clothes they made.</p>
<p>They change of their dress whatever they please,<br />
Their faces they cannot exchange with like ease.</p>
<p>To Sir Samsing&rsquo;s house the bride they conveyed,<br />
Of the ruddy gold no spare was made.</p>
<p>On the bridal throne the bride they plac&rsquo;d,<br />
They skinked the mead for the bride to taste.</p>
<p>Then said from his place the court buffoon,<br />
&ldquo;Methinks thou art Ingefred not Gudrune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From off her hand a gold ring she took,<br />
Which she gave the buffoon with entreating look.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an oaf and have drunk too hard,<br
/>
To words of mine pay no regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas deep at night, and down fell the mist,<br />
To her bed the young bride they assist.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Sir Samsing spoke to his nightingales twain:<br />
&ldquo;Before my young bride sing now a strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A song now sing which shall avouch<br />
Whether I&rsquo;ve a maiden or none in my couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A maid&rsquo;s in the bed, that&rsquo;s certain and
sure,<br />
Gudrune is standing yet on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proud Ingefred straight from my couch retire!<br />
Gudrune come hither, or dread my ire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, Gudrune, with open heart,<br />
What made thee from thy bed depart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, alas! dwelt near the strand,<br />
When war and bloodshed filled the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full eight there were broke into my bower,<br />
One only ravished my virgin flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon her fair cheek he gave a kiss:<br />
&ldquo;My dearest, my dearest, all sorrow dismiss;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My swains they were that broke into thy bower,<br />
&rsquo;Twas I that gathered thy virgin flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Fair Ingefred gained, because bride she had been,<br />
One of the King&rsquo;s knights of handsome mien.</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>SIR RIBOLT.</h2>
<p>Ribolt the son of a Count was he&mdash;<br />
Gulborg he courted in secrecy.</p>
<p>Since she was a child the maid he woo&rsquo;d,<br />
And till she had come to womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gulborg do thou become my bride,<br />
In a better land then thou shalt reside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unto the land I thee will bear,<br />
Where grief ne&rsquo;er comes the mind to tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To an island &rsquo;neath a blissful sky,<br />
Where thou shalt live and never die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the land thou never me wilt bear,<br />
But grief shall come the mind to tear.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Nor me to the isle wilt thou convey<br />
Where I&rsquo;ve no death to the Lord to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O there no grass but the leek up-springs,<br />
And there no bird but the cuckoo sings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other water flows than wine,<br />
Thou may&rsquo;st believe these words of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how from the Castle can I fly?<br />
So many watch incessantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m watched by father, watched by mother,<br />
By sister I am watched, and brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m watched by the man to whom I&rsquo;m
plighted,<br />
And I fear him more than the rest united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although by all thy clan controll&rsquo;d,<br />
Thy promise to me thou yet shall hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my acton blue I thee will case,<br />
And my golden helm on thy head I&rsquo;ll place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gird thee with my sword of worth,<br />
Then none will think that a maid rides forth.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Decked with my gilded spurs so free,<br />
Thou off may&rsquo;st ride though thy father see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er her he threw his mantle wide,<br />
And set her upon his steed of pride.</p>
<p>When on the moor themselves they found,<br />
Met them a Count, in arms renown&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Ribolt, hear, dear comrade mine,<br />
Say, who&rsquo;s that fair young page of thine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrade, it is my youngest brother,<br />
I&rsquo;ve ta&rsquo;en him from his doting mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It little avails such tales to tell;<br />
Gulborg, Gulborg, I know thee well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy scarlet dress thou may&rsquo;st disguise,<br />
But thy cheeks of rose I recognise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy hair I know of fairest sort,<br />
For long I&rsquo;ve served at thy father&rsquo;s court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thy garb and shoon I know thee not,<br />
But I know the knight who thy troth has got.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>A bracelet drew she forth of gold,<br />
And gave it to that Count so bold:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er thou rest thee at close of day,<br />
Be sure no word of me thou say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count he rode to Kulloe house,<br />
Where the kemps were drinking a deep carouse.</p>
<p>He enter&rsquo;d at Sir Truid&rsquo;s gate&mdash;<br />
At his table wide Sir Truid sate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Truid, thou sitt&rsquo;st the red wine taking,<br
/>
Whilst Ribolt off with thy bride is making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then through his hall Sir Truid roar&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Up, up, ye knights, take helm and sward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barely a mile had they advanced<br />
When fair Gulborg behind her glanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yonder my father&rsquo;s steed I see,<br />
And the knight who is betrothed to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gulborg, be therefore in no pain,<br />
But hold our steeds by the bridle rein.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;And though to earth thou see me fall,<br />
Gulborg thou must not upon me call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though thou see me freely bleed,<br />
Let not my name from thy mouth proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His helm on his head Sir Ribolt cast,<br />
Gulborg with her fair hands laced it fast.</p>
<p>Then, crying his cry, he slays outright<br />
Her father dear and her plighted knight,</p>
<p>And, at the second &ldquo;Halloo,&rdquo; he slew<br />
Her brothers with locks of yellow hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desist, O Ribolt, my heart&rsquo;s ador&rsquo;d,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time, &rsquo;tis time to sheath thy sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My youngest brother I pray thee spare,<br />
That he to my mother may tiding bear;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear her the tidings of the slaughter,<br />
O would she never had borne a daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarce had the name of Ribolt sounded,<br />
When Ribolt tottered, deadly wounded.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>He sheathed his faulchion, blood be-dyed:<br />
&ldquo;Come, dear Gulborg, we hence will ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They thread the mazes of the wood,<br />
No word escaped him, bad or good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, Ribolt, hear, my destined mate,<br />
Why art not glad as thou wast of late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gulborg, I feel my life-blood leak,<br />
Gulborg, I feel me faint and weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But chiefly, chiefly I look not pleas&rsquo;d<br />
Because Death&rsquo;s hand my heart has seiz&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself of my girdle I&rsquo;ll dis-array,<br />
And thy streaming blood will stanch and stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless thee ever, my own true love,<br />
Of service slight will thy girdle prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when to the Castle gate they won,<br />
His mother stood there and leaned thereon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, my son, thou art welcome twice,<br />
And thy fair young bride she is welcome thrice.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;I ne&rsquo;er have seen a bride so pale<br />
Come travelling over hill and dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If pale she be is a wonder slight,<br />
When she has witness&rsquo;d so hard a fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant I may retain my breath<br />
Whilst parting presents I bequeath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my father I give my courser tall,<br />
O mother I pray thee a priest to call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And unto my brother, who&rsquo;s standing near,<br />
I give Gulborg whom I love so dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O willingly her to wife I&rsquo;d take,<br />
If, brother, &rsquo;twere not for the black sin&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Lord God me in my trouble aid,<br />
So sure as she is for me a maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas only once that I had the bliss<br />
From her rosy mouth to snatch a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O better, better to sink in death,<br />
Than unto two brothers plight my faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Ribolt was dead ere the cock did cry,<br />
Gulborg was dead ere the sun was high.</p>
<p>They bore from the Castle corses three,<br />
A handsome corse was each to see.</p>
<p>The one was Ribolt, the other his bride,<br />
His mother the third, of grief she died.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
